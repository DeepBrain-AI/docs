:::

QuickStart initializes AIPlayer to automatically load the default AI. Once the loading completes, AI will be able to speak. It may take several minutes until it starts speaking depending on the network conditions, as there is a default loading time on the first run. After the first speaking, you can press the button at the top of the screen to make the AI speak different sentences. For details, refer to the sample project (source code).
