**The SDK authentication is enabled automatically on this page**. When the screen appears, the authentication action is automatically called, so there is no need to take any other action. All you need to do is input the appId, userkey, uuid, and target platform obtained above. Once authenticated, authentication is maintained until the app is closed, so there is no need to authenticate again. If the menu still doesn't work, check if there is an error in the authentication function(AuthStart) callback. Most of the time, token refresh is the problem.
