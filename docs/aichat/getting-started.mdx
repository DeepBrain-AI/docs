- Function Guide Bot : A function guide bot is provided in order to clearly guide the user through the various functions needed to set up a chatbot(Cf. Entity, Intent, etc.). Refer to the ‘Chatbot Set-Up’ document in order to learn more.
- Sample Bot (by industrial line) : A sample bot is a ready-made chatbot attached with some basic functions that are needed by various business lines, to assist the user with a simple set-up. If you face trouble trying to set up a chatbot for your needs, you can select the sample bot and tweak with it for a simple set-up.
